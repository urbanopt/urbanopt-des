# URBANopt District Energy Systems (DES)

## Overview

The **URBANopt District Energy Systems (DES) Package** is an extension of the [URBANopt SDK](https://github.com/urbanopt) designed to analyze the results of URBANopt simulated **district energy systems**. This package combines the results from **OpenStudio/EnergyPlus** with the results from **Modelica/Buildings Library** to provide detailed thermal and energy performance analysis at a district scale.

This project pulls in the GeoJSON to Modelica Translator (and required dependencies).

## Installation

`pip install urbanopt-des`

## Developer installation

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-des.git`
- Change directories into the repository: `cd urbanopt-des`
- We recommend using virtual environments on principle to avoid dependencies colliding between your Python projects. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is the Python native solution that will work everywhere, though other options may be more user-friendly.
  - Some popular alternatives are:
    - [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [the virtualenv plugin](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) work together nicely for Linux/Mac machines
    - [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
    - [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)
    - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

Once you have set up your environment:

1. `pip install -U pip setuptools poetry`
   - This will update pip & setuptools, and install Poetry to manage the project
1. `poetry install`
   - This installs the project and all dependencies
1. Activate pre-commit (only once, after making a new venv): `poetry run pre-commit install`
   - Runs automatically on your staged changes before every commit
   - Includes linting and formatting via [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
   - To check the whole repo, run `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`
     - Settings and documentation links for pre-commit and ruff are in .pre-commit-config.yaml and ruff.toml
     - Pre-commit will run automatically during CI, linting and formatting the entire repository.

## Testing

Tests are run with `poetry run pytest`

Test output will be in tests/test_output/

## Example Projects

Example projects leveraging this library will be shared shortly.
